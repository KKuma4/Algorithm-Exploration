# Algorithm-Exploration
# Solving various puzzles and timing them for a Computer Science Project.

**This page's sole purpose is to record my progress with these puzzles.**

Will be using Markdown for this repository. Link for help in markdown : https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/. 

## Pyraminx Duo

**Overall**

Number of Attempts | Average Time (seconds)
 -------------------|---------
5     |   12.01
12 | 12.37 
25 | 12.37

### Techniques used

Due to the puzzle's lack of complexity compared to the other puzzles, no specific algorithm was used. Hence due to this reason, there are no names of the algorithms. 

#### Solved edges with a different color centre 

Perspective required when the color of the centre is adjacent to the same colored side 

_Solution_: L R' R L

#### Different edges and different centre color

Find the common 'side' of a chosen color by tracking the edges and the location of the centre with the edge.  

_Solution_: U L' R' U

## Pyraminx (4x4x4)

Number of Attempts | Average Time (seconds)
 -------------------|---------
5     |   96.09
12 | 81.01
25 | 82.00
### Techniques Used : Layer By Layer 

Involves finding the right sides for each color by solving for the centre pieces. No specific algorithm as this requires observation and planning ahead. 

Then in order to fill the edges of the sides, align the piece with the side's color and the color of the 'base'. Align three pieces with the same color, making a 'block' and follow this algorithm. 

_Left_ : R U' R

_Right_ : L' U L
