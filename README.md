# Algorithm-Exploration
# Solving various puzzles and timing them for a Computer Science Project.

**This page's sole purpose is to record my progress with these puzzles.**

Will be using Markdown for this repository. Link for help in markdown : https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/. 

## Pyramix Duo

**Overall**

Number of Attempts | Average Time (seconds)
 -------------------|---------
5     |   12.01
12 | 12.37 
25 | 12.37

### Techniques used for minimal moves ####

Due to the puzzle's lack of complexity compared to the other puzzles, no specific algorithm was used. Hence due to this reason, there are no names of the algorithms. 

#### Solved edges with a different color centre 

Perspective required when the color of the centre is adjacent to the same colored side 

_Solution_: L R' R L

#### Different edges and different centre color

Find the common 'side' of a chosen color by tracking the edges and the location of the centre with the edge.  

_Solution_: U L' R' U
